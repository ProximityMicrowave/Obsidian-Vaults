# Perennian Sisterhood
The Perennian Sisterhood, sometimes just called Perennian's for short, is a race of all female clones. Each of them have been genetically engineered to meet their peoples definition of perfection. They are among the most technologically advanced [Humans](Human) in the galaxy.

## Appearance
Perennians are all approximately six-feet three-inches tall. They keep a youthful appearance typically not appearing older than thirty. They are renowned throughout the galaxy for their beauty. Most have white hair due to age, however their natural hair color lingers for an extremely long time and though they of course have the technology to color their hair, colored hair is a strong indicator of youth, while white hair is considered dignified and a sign of true adulthood.

Each Perennian is of a lineage, when a Perennian is lost, dies, or exiled, she is cloned and a repository of memories from their lineage known as an [[Almanac]] is passed on to the new custodian of the lineage.

### Fashion and Clothing
Perennians are typically seen wearing form fitting conservative clothing, revealing very little skin. Their clothing is made from a nano-fabric which adjusts with temperature to maintain a comfortable internal temperature in a wide range of environments, as such they are usually seen wearing the same or similar clothing in almost any environment.

## Social Structure
Perennians generally adhere to a flat social structure. Most decisions are made by consensus and during times of crisis temporary leadership is appointed and given only the necessary authority to carry out their directive.

The Ragnarok Chapter of the Perennian Sorority is currently being lead by a council of scientists, charged with overseeing the completion of the [[The Plan]].

### Role of Age
Perennians are extremely long lived as a species, typically only dying due to extreme physical trauma. As a result it takes some time for young Perennian's to be given the full respect of adulthood. While perennians are considered physically mature by age twenty and able to live on their own by age thirty, they are typically not considered full adults until the age of five-hundred, before that time they are unofficially barred from positions of authority, and their voice will carry little weight among their people.

### Wealth
Perennians are an egalitarian post-scarcity society with no use for money. Large scale projects which require vast resources are voted on by the community or directed by emergency leadership.

## Religion
Perennians as a culture hold strongly to values of rational atheism. The perceive the universe as an emergent system, one of near infinite complexity born from a series of very simple foundational rules. This is not to say however that Perennians lack any sense of spirituality, they will occasionally initiate hallucinatory states both for recreation and as part of a search for meaning and they hold their ancestors in deep reverence, and are sometimes found praying to the earlier inheritors of their lineage for strength.

## The Ephemeris
The Ephemeris is a vast database containing the stored memories and genetic profiles of every member of the Perennial Sorority to have ever lived.
### Almanac
Each living member of the Perennial Sorority is custodian to a memory storage device called an Almanac. The Almanac contains the complete life experiences of every member of that individuals lineage traced back to it's inception.
### Index
Like an Almanac an Index is a memory storage device used by Perrenians to store a backup of their own personal memories, as well as Core Memories from the previous keepers of their Almanac.
## History
The Perennial Sorority was founded four-hundred thousand years ago by a religious sect of nuns on the Planet Anwnn. As their numbers began to dwindle from attrition, they turned to cloning to replenish their numbers. Eventually their home world and the origin of their religion was overtaken by turnover, leaving the remote colony as one of the last vestiges of that lost civilization. They acquired memory storage technology from intergalactic merchants and began constructing the Alminacs and what would later become The Ephemeris. As the millennia passed they moved away from their religious roots and began to focus on peaceful scientific and cultural research. Their civilization grew and prospered but they were determined to never make the mistakes of the empire they were once a part of. They maintained a strong isolationist policy and never succumbing to colonial ambitions.
### The Exodus
Ten-thousand years ago, [[The Inter-dimensional Horror]] descended upon their world, rapidly and without warning. The [[Arienhod]] was the only ship to their knowledge able to escape their world. Before fleeing the system they were able to acquire a backup copy of The Ephemeris. There are almost certainly other Perennian survivors out in the galaxy, but without The Ephemeris they have no hope of rebuilding The Perennial Sorority.
### Arrival on Ragnarok
Prior to the attack on their world, the Perennial Sorority had detected a massive explosion on par with a small supernova that had radiated from a small planet five-thousand light-years away. With no clear plan of where to go, the survivors aboard the [[Arienhod]] decided to investigate what could have caused such a massive explosion to emanate from a planet. While long range surveillance had detected that the surface of the planet had been completely destroyed, as they approached the planet they observed that the surface was repairing itself and that a series of [[gigantic pillars]] appeared to be responsible.<br>
Upon their arrival they found that several post-human species who appear to have colonized the planet before the incident had survived, their civilizations destroyed, they had emerged from shelters surrounding the pillars and begun to rebuild from nothing, over the last five-thousand years having achieved an Early Iron-age level of technology.<br>
The survivors aboard the Arienhod, discovered that the pillars reached deep into the planets core and tapped into a vast power source. They began to devise [[The Plan]], building a permanent settlement on the planet to house them while carrying out their research. They named the planet Ragnarok after ancient mythology for the planets seeming propensity for blowing itself up.
