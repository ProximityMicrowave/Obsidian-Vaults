# Kira Cordelia
Kira is a 200 year old [[Perennian]], and one of only thirty-three [[Perennian]] children born on Ragnarok since their arrival.

Forty years ago she left her people to explore the world on her own, hoping to find an alternative to [[The Plan]]. In the meantime she is exploring the planet documenting the various cultures in the hopes of preserving them.

Six years ago in her adventures she met up with a [[Niuren]] named [[Korek]], after two years the two were married. Since [[Perennian]]'s have no concept of marriage, the marriage aspect of their relationship is far more important to [[Korek]] than to herself.
